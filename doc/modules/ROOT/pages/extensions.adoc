= Extensions

Here's a list of notable nREPL extensions (middleware or transports) you might encounter in the wild.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure you're using the latest versions of those middlewares, as
all of them added support for nREPL 0.4+ fairly recently.
====

== Official

Official extensions are developed and maintained by nREPL's Core Team and are
hosted under the nREPL GitHub organization.

=== Middleware

==== ClojureScript Support

* link:https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[Piggieback]

The following ClojureScript REPLs are leveraging piggieback internally to provide
nREPL support.

* link:https://github.com/nrepl/weasel[Weasel]
* link:https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel[figwheel]
* link:https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main[figwheel-main]
* link:https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs] (it actually
only stubs the piggieback API, leverages its own nREPL middleware
internally for ClojureScript evaluation)

=== Transports

==== HTTP Support

* link:https://github.com/nrepl/drawbridge[drawbridge]

==== Transit Support

* link:https://github.com/nrepl/fastlane[fastlane]

== Third-party

Third-party extensions are not developed and maintained by nREPL's Core Team and are
hosted outside the nREPL GitHub organization.

=== Middleware

==== Clojure Editor Support

* link:https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[cider-nrepl]: A collection of nREPL middleware designed to enhance CIDER (and Clojure editors in general).
* link:https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl[refactor-nrepl]: A collection of functionality designed to support editor refactoring features.
* link:https://github.com/liquidz/iced-nrepl[iced-nrepl]: nREPL middleware to support vim-iced.
* link:https://github.com/nubank/midje-nrepl[midje-nrepl]: nREPL middleware to run Midje tests.

==== Debugging

* link:https://clojure-emacs.github.io/sayid/[sayid]: A powerful tracing/debugging tool. It is a great alternative of CIDER-nREPL's basic tracing functionality.
* link:https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture-nrepl[scope-capture-nrepl]: A companion library to scope-capture, providing an nREPL middleware that lets you put your REPL in the context of an Execution Point.

==== Deprecated

This section lists middlewares that were somewhat prominent in the
past, but were replaced by alternatives down the road.

* link:https://github.com/pallet/ritz/tree/develop/nrepl-middleware[nrepl-middleware],
  part of link:https://github.com/pallet/ritz[ritz] that provides a
  variety of nREPL middleware supporting various enhanced REPL
  operations (including apropos, javadoc lookup, code completion, and
  an alternative eval implementation). **(superseded by `cider-nrepl`)**
* link:https://github.com/technomancy/javert[Javert] provides a basic
  object inspector. **(superseded by `cider-nrepl`)**
* link:https://github.com/thunknyc/nrepl-profile[nrepl-profile]: profiling middleware,
which was eventually integrated into `cider-nrepl`.


[NOTE]

This list doesn't aim to be complete. You can find more 3rd-party middlewares listed
